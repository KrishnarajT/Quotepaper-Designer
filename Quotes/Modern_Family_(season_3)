[while getting a massage, Jay accidentally said "I love you" to Phil]
Phil: I really need to talk to you.
Jay: You really don't.
Phil: Jay, please. It's about work. I got a text during your massage. I've been offered a partnership in a new agency.
Jay: [relieved] Oh. Good for you!
Phil: Well, I'm not so sure. I mean, there's... there's a big upside, but I have a stable job right now. I have three kids, and at least one of 'em's going to college. Worse case scenario, they all go.

Mitchell: We're interviewing prospective mothers for adoption.
Cameron: It's quite an ordeal. You want to look good, make a good first impression. It's kind of like going on a first date.
Mitchell: Actually, it's the opposite of a first date. You don't want to have sex, but you do want to have a baby.

Claire: You know, I made the egg that made you that made that project, so in a lot of ways, that project is mine!

Gloria: [Yelling on the phone in Spanish] Yes! Auntie! Yes! You're 73 years old, not 20! Of course, but I'm in the United States so kill yourself! Kill yourself, because I don't care!
[laughs]
Gloria: Ok, yes! I love you! Muah! Muah! Muah!
[hangs up]
Manny: I understood "crazy old witch," "go kill yourself," then "I love you."
Jay: I'll never get this; how you all yell at each other.
Gloria: That's how you know that your family loves you, when they feel free to scream at you.
