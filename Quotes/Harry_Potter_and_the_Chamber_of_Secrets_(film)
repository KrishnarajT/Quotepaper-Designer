Lucius Malfoy: Hmm, you must be very brave to mention his name. Or very foolish.

Lucius Malfoy: Busy time at the Ministry, Arthur? All those extra raids; I do hope they're paying you overtime. [Picks up one of Ginny's books] Though judging by the state of this, I'd say not. [Places the book back in Ginny's cauldron; another book has been slipped in with it, though only Harry notices] What's the use of being a disgrace to the name of wizard... if they don't even pay you well for it?
Arthur Weasley: We have a very different idea about what disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy.
Lucius Malfoy: Clearly. Associating with Muggles... And I thought your family could sink no lower. [Arthur glares at him as if ready to hit him] I'll see you at work.

McGonagall: Yes, Miss Granger?
Hermione: Professor, I was wondering if you'd tell us about the Chamber of Secrets.
McGonagall: [Seeing everyone's faces] Very well. Well, you all knew, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago, by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. Now three of the founders co-existed quite harmoniously. One did not.
Ron: [Sarcastic] Three guesses who.
McGonagall: Salazar Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts. He believed magical learning should be kept within all-magic families &ndash; in other words, "pure-bloods". Unable to sway the others, he decided to leave the school. Now according to legend, Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in this castle, known as the Chamber of Secrets. Though shortly before departing, he sealed it... until that time when his own true heir returned to the school. The heir alone would be able to open the chamber and unleash the horror within, and by so doing, purge the school of all those who, in Slytherin's view, were unworthy to study magic.
Hermione: Muggle-borns.
McGonagall: Well, naturally the school has been searched many times. No such chamber has been found.
Hermione: Professor, what exactly does legend tell us lies within the Chamber?
McGonagall: Well the Chamber is said to be home to something that only the Heir of Slytherin can control. it is said to be the home... of a monster.

Harry: Maybe Ron's right, Hermione. I mean, look at his family. The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin for centuries.
Ron: Crabbe and Goyle must know. Maybe we could trick them into telling.
Hermione: Even they aren't that thick. But there might be another way.

Harry: [reads the paper from the book taken by Hermione] "Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land, none is more deadly than the basilisk. Capable of living for hundreds of years, instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpent's eye. Spiders flee before it." Ron, this is it. The monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a basilisk. That's why I can hear it speak. It's a snake.
Ron: But if it kills by looking people in the eye, why is it no one's dead?
Harry: Because no one did look it in the eye. Not directly, at least. Colin saw it through his camera. Justin; Justin must have seen the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick. Nick got the full blast of it. But he's a ghost, he couldn't die again. And Hermione had the mirror. I bet you anything she was using it to look around corners in case it came along.

Lockhart: Books can be misleading.
Harry: You wrote them!
Lockhart: My dear boy, do use your common sense? My books wouldn't have sold half as well if people didn't think I'd done all those things.
Harry: [Realizing; outraged] You're a fraud. You've just been taking credit for what other wizards have done.
Ron: Is there anything you can do? 
Lockhart: Yes. Now that you mention it, I'm rather gifted with Memory Charms. Otherwise, you see, all those wizards would have gone blabbing, and I'd never have sold another book. In fact, I'm going to have to do the same to you. [grabs his wand, only to have Harry and Ron aim theirs at him.]
Harry: Don't even think about it.
[Ron motions for Lockhart to drop his wand. Lockhart drops his wand.]

Harry It's a snake skin.
Ron Bloody hell. Whoever shed this must be 60 feet long, or more. [Lockhart pretends to pass out. Ron notices.] Heart of a lion, this one.
Lockhart [jumps up and grabs Ron's wand; aims the wand at Harry, then at Ron, then at Harry again] The adventure ends here, boys. But don't fret. [points it at Ron] The world will know our story. How I was too late to save the girl. How you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body. So... [points it at Harry] You first, Mr. Potter. Say goodbye... to your memories. OBLIVIATE!
[Lockhart is blasted into the ceiling by the spell, having used Ron's broken wand for the job, causing a cave-in that separates him and Ron from Harry.]
Ron Harry?! Harry!
Harry Ron! Ron, are you okay?!
Ron I'm fine!
Lockhart [sits up and grins at Ron] Hello. Who are you?
Ron Uh, Ron Weasley.
Lockhart Really? And, um, who-who am I?
Ron [to Harry] Lockhart's Memory Charm backfired! He hasn't got a clue who he is!
Lockhart It's an odd sort of place, isn't it? [picks up a rock] Do you live here?
Ron [takes the rock from Lockhart, confused] No.
Lockhart Really?
[Ron hits Lockhart on the head with the rock, knocking him out.]
Ron What do I do now?
Harry You wait here and try to shift some of this rock so we can get back through. I'll go on and find Ginny.
Ron Okay.

[Harry has just entered the Chamber of Secrets. He see Ginny Weasley lying motionless at the end of the chamber.]
Harry Ginny. [Runs to her] Ginny. Ginny. Please don't be dead. Wake up. Wake up!
Tom Riddle [suddenly appears out of nowhere] She won't wake.
Harry Tom? Tom Riddle? What do you mean she won't wake? She's not...?
Tom Riddle She's still alive, but only just.
Harry Are you a ghost?
Tom Riddle A memory, preserved in a diary for fifty years.
Harry [touches her hand] She's cold as ice. Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up. [Tom picks up Harry's wand] You've got to help me, Tom. There's a basilisk--
Tom Riddle It won't come until it's called.
Harry Give me my wand, Tom.
Tom Riddle You won't be needing it.
Harry Listen, we've got to go, we've got to save her!
Tom Riddle I'm afraid I can't do that. You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker... I grow stronger. Yes, Harry. It was Ginny Weasley who opened the Chamber of Secrets.  [flashback of Ginny watching the Chamber's entrance in the toilets open]
Harry No. She couldn't. I mean, she wouldn't!
Tom Riddle It was Ginny who set the basilisk on the mudbloods and Filch's cat. It was Ginny who wrote the threatening messages on the walls. [flashback of Ginny writing the massages]
Harry But why?
Tom Riddle Because I told her to. You'll find I can be very... persuasive. Not that she knew what she was doing. She was in, shall we say, a kind of trance. Still, the power of the diary began to scare her, and she tried to dispose of it in the girl's bathroom. [flashback of Ginny running into a toilet cubicle and throwing the diary into the toilet] And then who should find it... but you? The very person I was most anxious to meet.
Harry And why did you want to meet me?
Tom Riddle I knew I had to talk to you, meet you if I could. So I decided to show you my capture of that brainless oaf, Hagrid, to gain your trust.
Harry [angrily] Hagrid's my friend! And you framed him, didn't you?
Tom Riddle It was my word against Hagrid's. Only Dumbledore seemed to think he was innocent.
Harry [smiling] I bet Dumbledore saw right through you.
Tom Riddle He certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after that. I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the Chamber again while I was still at school, so I decided to leave behind a diary; preserving my sixteen year-old self in its pages so that one day, I would be able to lead another to finish Salazar Slytherin's noble work.
Harry Well, you haven't finished it this time. In a few hours, the mandrake draught will be ready and everyone who was Petrified will be all right again.
Tom Riddle Haven't I told you? Killing mudbloods doesn't matter to me anymore. For many months now, my new target... has been you. How is it that a baby with no extraordinary magical talent was able to defeat the greatest wizard of all time? How did you escape, with nothing but a scar, while Lord Voldemort's powers were destroyed?
Harry Why do you care how I escaped? Voldemort was after your time.
Tom Riddle: Voldemort... is my past, present, and future. [uses Harry's wand to write his full name in midair: TOM MARVOLO RIDDLE. He slashes the wand and the letters rearrange to become I AM LORD VOLDEMORT, before they fade]
Harry [stunned] You. You're the heir of Slytherin. You're Voldemort.
Tom Riddle Surely, you didn't think I was going to keep my filthy Muggle father's name? No. I fashioned myself a new name. A name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak, when I became the greatest sorcerer in the world!
Harry Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world!
Tom Riddle Dumbledore's been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me!
Harry He'll never be gone! Not as long as those who remain are loyal to him! [Fawkes suddenly enters the chamber] Fawkes? [Fawkes drops the Sorting Hat to Harry and leaves]
Tom Riddle So... this is what Dumbledore sends his great defender: a songbird and an old hat. [turns to the statue of Salazar Slytherin and speaks in Parseltongue, subtitled] Speak to me, Slytherin, greatest of the Hogwarts Four. [The statue's mouth begins to open] Let's match the power of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Slytherin, against the famous Harry Potter. [The basilisk's snout emerges from the mouth; Harry turns and runs as the creature fully emerges] [in Parseltongue, subtitled] Kill him! [to Harry] Parseltongue won't save you now, Potter! It only obeys me!

Lucius: The culprit has been identified, I presume?
Dumbledore: Oh, yes.
Lucius: And...? Who was it?
Dumbledore: [after exchanging a look with Harry] Voldemort.
Lucius: Ah.
Dumbledore: Only this time, he chose to act through somebody else... by means of this. [He holds up Tom Riddle's diary; which Lucius had slipped into Ginny's cauldron. Dobby tugs Harry's sleeve uneasily and looks over at Lucius.]
Lucius: I see.
Dumbledore: Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter discovered it. One hopes that no more of Voldemort's old school things should find their way into innocent hands. The consequences for the one responsible would be... severe.
Lucius Well... let us hope that Mr. Potter will always be around to save the day.
Harry Don't worry. I will be.

Harry Mr. Malfoy. Mr. Malfoy! [Lucius turns around] I have something of yours. [Hands him the diary]
Lucius Mine? I don't know what you're talking about.
Harry Oh, I think you do, sir. I think you slipped the diary into Ginny Weasley's cauldron, that day at Diagon Alley.
Lucius You do, do you? [Hands the diary to Dobby] Well...[Whispers] why don't you prove it? [Harry doesn't answer because he just did] Come, Dobby.
Harry [Whispers to Dobby] Open it.
[Dobby opens up the diary and finds a folded black sock inside]
Lucius Dobby?
Dobby Master has given Dobby a sock.
Lucius What? [Turns around] I didn't give-
Dobby [Holding the sock in delight] Master has presented Dobby with clothes! Dobby is free!
[Harry pulls up his pant leg, revealing it was his sock]
Lucius [Enraged] You lost me my SERVANT! [Pulls out his wand from his cane and points it directly at Harry. Dobby then stands in his way]
Dobby You shall not harm Harry Potter!
Lucius Avada &ndash; [Dobby blasts him backwards across the hall; stands up, viciously] Your parents were meddlesome fools, too. Mark my words, Potter. One day soon, you're going to meet the same, sticky end. [Walks away]
Dobby: Harry Potter freed Dobby. How can Dobby ever repay him?
Harry: Just promise me something.
Dobby: Anything, sir.
Harry: Never try to save my life again.
[Dobby grins sheepishly]
