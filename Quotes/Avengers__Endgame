[Inside the Avengers Compound, the heroes are conducting a time travel experiment]
Banner: Okay, here we go. Time travel test number one. Scott, fire up the uhhhh…the van thing. [Scott opens the portal]
Steve: Breakers are set, emergency generators are on standby.
Banner: Good. 'Cause if we blow the grid, I don't wanna lose tiny here in the 1950's.
Scott: Excuse me?
Natasha: He's kidding. You can't say things like that.
Banner: It was a bad joke.
Natasha: You were kidding, right?
Banner: [whispering to Romanoff] I have no idea. We're talking about time travel here. Either it's all a joke, or none of it is. [loudly and gives Scott a thumbs up] We're good! Get your helmet on, Scott. I'm gonna send you back a week, let you walk around for an hour, then bring you back in 10 seconds. Makes sense?
Scott: Perfectly not confusing.
Steve: Good luck, Scott. You got this.
Scott: You're right. I do, Captain America!
Banner: On the count of 3. 3…2…1!
[Bruce presses a button, and Scott disappears into the Quantum Tunnel. In 5 seconds, Bruce presses a button, and someone in the Ant-Man suit comes back. A teenager appears out of it]
Young Scott: Uh, guys? T-This doesn't feel right.
Steve: What is this?
Banner: What's going on?
Natasha: Who is that?
[Banner pushes another couple of buttons, trying to fix the problem]
Banner: Hold on.
Natasha: Is that Scott?
Young Scott: [irritated] Yes, it's Scott!
[Scott gets sucked in back into the quantum tunnel, and it appears to be an old man in the Ant-Man suit]
Elderly Scott: OWW!! My back…!!
Steve: What is this?
Banner: Can I get a little space here.
Steve: Yeah, yeah. Can you bring him back?
Banner: I'm working on it! [taps the side of the button pad, trying to pull back Scott]
[After a moment, another person appears in front of them. This time, it's a baby in the Ant-Man suit]
Steve: It's a baby.
Banner: It's Scott!
Rogers: As a baby!
Banner: He'll grow!
Rogers: [exasperated] Bring Scott back!
Banner: When I say kill the power, kill the power.
Natasha: [annoyed, she goes to kill the power] Oh, my God.
Banner: [configuring the time machine] And…kill it!
[Natasha kills the power as Banner sends baby Scott back into the Quantum Realm and retrieves Scott's present self, who is shaken from the Avengers' experiment]
Scott: Somebody peed my pants…
Romanoff: Oh, thank God.
Scott: But I don't know if it was baby-me or old-me. Or…just me-me.
Banner: Time travel! [Steve just shakes his head and walks away] What? I see this as an absolute win.

[Nebula is fitting a time travel suit onto Clint Barton]
Banner: Clint, now you're gonna feel a little discombobulated from the chronoshift, don't worry about that--
James Rhodes: Wait, wait, wait a second. Let me ask you something. If we can do this, you know…go back in time, why don't we just find baby Thanos, you know, and… [makes a gesture of strangling a baby with a rope, complete with "choking sound"]
Banner: [disgusted] First of all, that's horrible...
Rhodes: It's Thanos.
Banner: ...and secondly, time doesn't work that way. Changing the past doesn't change the future!
Scott: Look, we go back, we get the stones before Thanos gets them? Thanos doesn't have the stones. Problem solved!
Clint Barton: Bingo.
Nebula: That's not how it works.
Barton: Well, that's what I heard.
Banner: Wait, but who? Who told you that?
Rhodes: [counting with his fingers] [[Star Trek, [[The Terminator|Terminator, Timecop, Time After Time…
Scott: …[[Quantum Leap…
Rhodes: [[A Wrinkle in Time (2018 film)|Wrinkle in Time, [[Somewhere in Time…
Scott: [[Hot Tub Time Machine…
Rhodes: Hot Tub Time Machine, [[Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure - basically, any movie that deals with time travel.
Scott: [[Die Hard? No, that's not one.
Rhodes: This is known.
Banner: I don't know why everyone believes that, but that isn't true. Think about it. If you travel to the past, that past becomes your future. And your former present becomes the past, which can't now be changed by your new future!
Nebula: Exactly.
Scott: [confused] So [[Back to the Future is a bunch of bullshit?

Steve: Okay, so the "how" works. Now we gotta figure out the "when" and the "where." Almost all of us has had an encounter with at least one of the six Infinity Stones.
Stark: Well, I'd substitute the word "encounter" for "damn well near been killed by" one of the six Infinity Stones.
Scott: I haven't, I don't even know what the hell you're all talking about.
Banner: Regardless, we only have enough Pym Particles for one round trip each, and these Stones have been in a lot of different places throughout history.
Stark: Our history. So, not a lot of convenient spots to just drop in.
Clint: Which means we have to pick our targets.
Stark: Correct.
Steve: Let's start with the Aether. Thor, what do you know?
Natasha: [Thor is sitting on a chair with his sunglasses on] Is he asleep?
Rhodey: No. I'm pretty sure he's dead.
Thor: [wakes up] Where to start? Umm…the Aether, first, is not a stone, someone called it a stone before. It's more of a…an angry sludge thing, so…someone's gonna need to amend that. Here's an interesting story though, many years ago…my grandfather had to hide the stones from the Dark Elves, wooooh, scary beings. So Jane… [an image of Jane Foster pops up on the screen] Oh, there she is. That's Jane. She's– an old flame of mine. She– she stuck her hand inside a rock [[Thor: The Dark World|this one time– and then the Aether stuck itself inside her. And she became very, very sick. So I had to take her to Asgard, which is where I'm from. And we had to try and fix her. We were dating at the time, you see. I got to introduce her to my mother…who's dead… [seeming on the verge of tears] …and, oh, you know, Jane and I aren't even dating anymore, these things happen though you know, nothing last forever… [Tony starts to push Thor back to his chair] I'm not done yet, the only thing permanent in life is impermanence.
Stark: Awesome. Eggs? Breakfast?
Thor: No. I'd like a Bloody Mary.
Rocket: Quill said he [[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|stole the Power Stone from Morag.
Scott: Is that a person?
Rocket: Morag's a planet, Quill was a person.
Scott: A planet? Like in outer space?
Rocket: [Mockingly] Oh, look: it's like a little puppy, all happy and everything. [starts petting Scott] Do you want to go to space? You want to go to space, puppy? I'll take you to space!
Nebula: Thanos [[Avengers: Infinity War|found the Soul Stone on Vormir.
Natasha: [in a business-like tone] What is Vormir?
Nebula: A dominion of death, at the very center of Celestial existence. It's where... Thanos [[Avengers: Infinity War|murdered my sister.
Scott: Not it.
Natasha: [lying on a paper-filled table] That Time Stone guy…
Banner: [lying down on the floor] [[Doctor Strange.
Natasha: Yeah, what kind of doctor was he?
Stark: Neuro stuff meets rabbit from a hat. Nice place in the Village, though.
Banner: Yeah. Sullivan Street. [Corrects himself] Hmm– Bleecker.
Natasha: Wait, he lived in New York?
Stark: [Sarcastically] No, [[Doctor Strange (film)|he lived in Toronto.
Natasha: Guys, if you pick [[The Avengers (2012 film)|the right year, there are three Stones in New York.
Banner: [Sits up in surprise] Shut the front door!

[Bruce Banner is trying to reason with the Ancient One to let him have the Time Stone]
The Ancient One: I'm sorry, I can't help you, Bruce. If I give up the Time Stone to help your Reality, I'm dooming my own.
Bruce Banner:  With all due respect, I'm not sure the science really supports that.
The Ancient One: [conjures a long ray, denoting the flow of time with the Infinity Stones circling around it] The Infinity Stones create what you experience as the flow of time. Remove one stone and that flow splits. [pulls out one of the Stones, which causes a black stream indicating a point of divergence to appear] Now, this may benefit your reality, but my new one… not so much. In this new branched Reality, without our chief weapon against the forces of darkness, our world will be overrun. Millions will suffer. So tell me Doctor, can your science prevent all that?
Banner: No, but we can erase it. Because once we are done with the stones, we can return each one to its own timeline at the moment it was taken. So, chronologically, in that reality, they never left.
The Ancient One: But you are leaving out the most important part. In order to return the stones, you have to survive.
Banner: We will. I will. I promise.
The Ancient One: I can't risk this Reality on a promise. It is the duty of the Sorcerer Supreme to protect the Time Stone.
Banner: Then, why the hell did Strange give it away?
The Ancient One: [Surprised] What did you say?
Banner: Strange, [[Avengers: Infinity War|he gave it away. He gave it to Thanos.
The Ancient One: Willingly?
Banner: Yes.
The Ancient One: Why?
Banner: I have no idea. Maybe he made a mistake.
The Ancient One: Or I did. [Reunites Banner's spirit with his body] Strange is meant to be the best of us.
Banner: So he must have done it for a reason.
The Ancient One: I fear you might be right. [Gives Bruce the Time Stone]
Banner: Thank you.
The Ancient One: I'm counting on you, Bruce. We all are.

[After the Snap is undone, Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor approach Thanos from 2014 after his attack on the New Avengers Facility, who is fully aware of his plan's success and his fate and the Avengers' attempts to undo his plan, and has arrived at Earth]
Iron Man: What's he been doing?
Thor: Absolutely nothing.
Captain America: Where are the stones?
Iron Man: Somewhere under all this. All I know is he doesn't have them.
Captain America: So we keep it that way.
Thor: You know it's a trap, right?
Iron Man: Yeah. And I don't much care.
Thor: Good. Just as long as we are all in agreement... [Summons Mjølnir and Stormbreaker] Let's kill him properly this time.
[The three walk over to confront Thanos face-to-face]
Thanos: You could not live with your own failure. And where did that bring you? Back to me. I thought by eliminating half of life, the other half would thrive. But you've shown me that's impossible. And as long as there are those that remember what was, there will always be those that are unable to accept what can be. They will resist.
Iron Man: Yep, we're all kinds of stubborn.
Thanos: I'm thankful. Because now, I know what I must do. I will shred this universe down to its last atom. And then, with the stones you've collected for me, create a new one. Teeming with life, that knows not what it has lost, but only what it has been given. [Thor starts up Stormbreaker and Mjolnir] A grateful universe.
Captain America: Born out of blood.
Thanos: They'll never know it. Because you won't be alive to tell them. [The three fight Thanos]

[In the final fight for the Nano Gauntlet with the Infinity Stones, Captain Marvel blasts at Thanos. Thanos pulls the Power Stone out of the Gauntlet and uses it in his free hand to hit Captain Marvel away. Stark looks in question at Strange, who simply raises one finger, reminding him that the one win over Thanos he foresaw is now at risk. Stark nods and Thanos then puts the Power Stone back into the Gauntlet, channeling the powers of the Infinity Stones. Stark attacks Thanos, pulling on the Gauntlet before Thanos punches him away, seemingly holding the Stones again]
Thanos: I am… inevitable.
