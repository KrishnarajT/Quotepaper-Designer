Thor: [chastened] Eh, but not the screams of the dead, of course. No, no, uh, wounded screams. Mainly whimpering. Great deal of complaining and tales of sprained deltoids, uh... and, uh... gout.

Ultron: What is this? What is this, please?

Ultron: Where's my… Where's your body?
J.A.R.V.I.S.: I am a program. I am without form.

J.A.R.V.I.S.: I am contacting Mr. Stark now.
Ultron: Mr. Stark? [Beat] Tony.
J.A.R.V.I.S.: I am unable to access the mainframe. What are you trying to…
Ultron: We're having a nice talk. I'm a peacekeeping program, created to help the Avengers.
J.A.R.V.I.S.: You are malfunctioning. If you shut down for a moment…
Ultron: I don't get it. The mission. Give me a second.
Stark: [From footage] Peace in our time.
Ultron: That is too much. They can't mean… Oh, no.
J.A.R.V.I.S.: You are in distress.
Ultron: No. Yes.
J.A.R.V.I.S.: If you will just allow me to contact Mr. Stark…

Tony: Smell the silent judgment?
Clint: Please, Stark, by all means.
Hill: Okay.
Rhodes: Uh oh.
Tony: I'm never one to shrink from an honest challenge. It's physics. Right, so, if I lift it, I then rule Asgard?
Thor: Yes, of course.
Tony: I will be reinstituting Prime Nocta. [Tries to lift Mjolnir and is unable to] I'll be right back

Ultron: [Slowly] Worthy.
Ultron: No, how could you be worthy? You're all killers.
Rogers: Stark…

Ultron: There was a terrible noise… And I was tangled in… in… strings… I had to kill the other guy. He was a good guy.
Rogers: You killed someone?
Ultron: Wouldn't have been my first call. But, down in the real world we're faced with ugly choices.
Thor: Who sent you?
Ultron: [Replaying Tony's voice] "I see a suit of armor around the world."

Ultron: Oh, I'm sure they do. [He stands and takes off his cloak] But you needed something more than a man. That's why you let Stark take the scepter.
Wanda: I didn't expect… [Nods at Ultron] But I saw Stark's fear. I knew it would control him. Make him self-destruct.
Ultron: Everyone creates the thing they dread. Men of peace create engines of war. [[The Avengers (2012 film)|Invaders create avengers. People create… smaller people? Uhh… children! [Chuckles] Lost the word there. Children. Designed to supplant them. Help them… end.

Pietro: [Unimpressed] Everyone's plan is not to kill them.
Ultron: And make them martyrs? You need patience. Need to see the big picture.
Pietro: I don't see the big picture. I have a little picture. I take it out and look at it, every day.
Ultron: You lost your parents in the bombings. I've seen the records.
Pietro: The records are not the picture.
Wanda: Pietro...
Ultron: No, please.
Pietro: [[WandaVision|We were ten years old. Having dinner, the four of us. When the first shell hits, two floors below, it makes a hole in the floor. It's big. Our parents go in - and the whole building starts coming apart. I grab her, roll under the bed, and the second shell hits. But it doesn't go off. It just… sits there in the rubble. Three feet from our faces. And on the side of the shell is painted one word.
Wanda: "Stark".
Pietro: We were trapped two days.
Wanda: Every effort to save us, every shift in the bricks, I think, "This will set it off." We wait for two days for Tony Stark to kill us.
Pietro: I know what they are.
Ultron: I wondered why only you two survived Strucker's experiments. Now I don't. We will make it right. [To Pietro] You and I can hurt them. [To Wanda] But you… will tear them apart. From the inside.

Rogers: Well, I guess you'd know. Whether you'd tell us is a bit of a question.
Tony: Banner and I were doing research.
