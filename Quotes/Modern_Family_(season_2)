Claire: Oh, that's the year your dad and I went to the Rose bowl.
Phil: Incredible game.
Claire: Yeah.
Luke: Mom, you look really pretty.
Claire: Thank you sweetheart.
Luke: So, what happened?
Phil: Well, Lukey, everyone gets older. Just 'cause parts of your mom aren't what they used to be, it doesn't mean-
Luke: I mean, what happened in the game?
Phil: [After getting a look from Claire] We got our butts kicked by Penn state. The parade was awesome though. Angela Lansbury was the grand marshal. "Good time, she wrote."

Phil: [confessional] You know what? You can insult a lot of things about me: my hair, my voice, my balance-board exercises, but don't insult my selling. That crosses a line. What line? Oh, you don't see it? That's 'cause I just sold it.

Claire: Your kids don't need to know who you were before you had them. They need to know who you wish you were, and they need to try to live up to that person. They're gonna fall short, but better they fall short of the fake you than the real you.
Phil: Which is why we don't hide anything.
Claire: That is the opposite of what I just said.
Phil: I was not listening.

Haley: Oh, my God. Please tell me this text is wrong. Did you really just go over to that kid's house and try and kiss him in front of a million people? 
Claire: Alex, did you do that?
Alex: You got a text?
Haley: Oh, yeah. Everybody knows. Do you know how embarrassing this is for me?!
Alex: This is all your fault! You're the one who said I had to kiss him or I was a lesbian!
Claire: Haley, did you say that to her?
Haley: Oh, don't turn this on me! Look at her shoes!
Alex: I'm never going back to school now.
Claire: No, sweetheart. Yes, you are. You are going back to school. But listen to me. Just because a boy sends you flirty texts doesn't mean you -
Alex: What?! You read my texts?!
Haley: You read her texts?! That's why you made me talk to her?!
Alex: You made her talk to me?!
Claire: I kind of feel like we're spinning out here a little bit. Look, Alex, the important thing here is that you have to be very careful how you behave around boys because it is so easy to get a reputation. 
Alex: Well, I'm sorry I'm not a perfect little good girl like you were!
Haley: Were you?
Claire: Oh.
Haley: <big>Were you?! I highly doubt it!</big>

Claire: [to Jay] Gloria is right. You being emotionally closed off makes it very difficult for your children to show affection.
Jay: Really?
Claire: Yes.
Jay: You have trouble showing affection in public places?
Claire: Yes.
Jay: You?
Claire: [changes tone] Yes.
Jay: Was that before or after you were delivered to my door wearing nothing but your underwear and a police blanket?

Haley: Oh my god, what?
Alex: You were arrested?
Luke: Awesome!
Claire: Not awesome! And I wasn't arrested. Your grandfather was just telling a joke.

Gloria: You're gonna miss church again? Last Sunday, you said that you had to go the office. The week before, you had breakfast with a friend.
Manny And before that, you thought you had a cold that turned out not to be a cold.
Jay: Because I babied it.
Gloria: You don't have to convince us. You have to convince Him.
Jay: Who, God? Me and God are good.
Gloria: How would you know?
Jay: Look, you feel God in church, which is great. I feel God out in nature, amongst his works.
Gloria: Are you gonna go to church next week?
Jay: We'll see.
Gloria: I know what "we'll see" means. If you're done with church, just say it.
Jay: I'm done with church.
Gloria: Don't say that!

Claire: Yeah, yeah. And then, she took off with him, didn't come back to the house until after I was asleep and then this morning, left a cute little note that said "Having breakfast with Robbie!"
Jay: What the hell is she doing, he's half her age!

Jay: Don't say it.
