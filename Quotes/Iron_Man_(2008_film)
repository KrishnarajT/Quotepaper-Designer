[After Tony Stark's one-night-stand with Christine Everheart]
Pepper Potts: I have your clothes here; they've been dry-cleaned and pressed. And there's a car waiting for you outside that will take you anywhere you'd like to go.
Everheart: You must be the famous Pepper Potts.
Pepper: [smiling] Indeed I am.
Everheart: After all these years, Tony still has you picking up the dry cleaning.
Pepper: I do anything and everything Mr. Stark requires. Including, occasionally, taking out the trash. [still smiling] Will that be all?

Tony: [to a dying Yinsen, as he attempts a breakout in his new battlesuit] We gotta go. Come on, move with me. We have a plan, and we're going to stick to it.
Yinsen: This was always the plan, Stark.
Tony: Come on, you're going to go see your family. Get up.
Yinsen: My family is dead, Stark. And I'm going to see them now. [sees Tony is upset] It's okay. I want this. I want this.
Tony: Thank you for saving me.
Yinsen: Don't waste it. Don't waste your life, Stark. [dies]

[Tony Stark addresses a press conference]
Tony: I never got to say goodbye to my father. There's questions I would've asked him. I would've asked him how he felt about what his company did, if he was conflicted, if he ever had doubts. Or maybe he was every inch of man we remember from the newsreels. I saw young Americans killed by the very weapons I created to defend them and protect them. And I saw that I had become part of a system that is comfortable with zero accountability.
Press Reporter #1: Mr. Stark, what happened over there?
Tony: I had my eyes opened. I came to realize that I had more to offer this world than just making things that blow up. And that is why, effective immediately, I am shutting down the weapons manufacturing division of Stark Industries. [reporters become agitated]

Tony: [after seeing the gold 3-D render of his suit] A little ostentatious, don't you think?
J.A.R.V.I.S.: [dripping with sarcasm] What was I thinking? You're usually so discreet.
Tony: [looks over at one of his vintage cars] Tell you what. Throw a little hot-rod red in there.
J.A.R.V.I.S.: Oh yes. That should help you keep a low profile. [seconds later] The render is complete.
Tony: [upon seeing the new render] Hey, I like it. Fabricate it, paint it.
J.A.R.V.I.S.: Beginning automated assembly. Estimated completion time is five hours.
Tony: [stands to leave for the event at Disney Hall] Don't wait up for me, honey.

Engineer: Mr. Stane. Sir, we've explored what you've asked of us and it seems as though there's a little hiccup. Actually, um... 
Stane: A hiccup?
Engineer: Yes, see to power the suit. sir, the technology doesn't actually exist. So it...
Stane: Wait, wait, the technology? [gestures towards the Arc Reactor] William, William... here is the technology. I've asked you to simply make it smaller.
Engineer: Yes, sir, and that's what we're trying to do, but... honestly, it's impossible.
Stane: [yelling] TONY STARK WAS ABLE TO BUILD THIS IN A CAVE! WITH A BOX OF SCRAPS!
Engineer: Well, I'm sorry. I'm not Tony Stark.

[Iron Monger pursues Iron Man to high altitudes; Iron Monger grabs Iron Man's thruster moments later]
Iron Monger: You had a great idea, Tony, but my suit is more advanced in every way!
Iron Man: How'd you solve the icing problem?
Iron Monger: "Icing problem"? [ice forms over suit, "eyes" flicker and go out, and its thrusters shut off]
Iron Man: Might wanna look into it. [thumps Stane on the helmet and sends him tumbling back to Earth]
