[During the Senate hearing on the Iron Man suit]
Senator Stern: My priority is to get the Iron Man weapon turned over to the people of the United States of America.
Tony: Well, you can forget it. I am Iron Man. The suit and I are one. To turn over the Iron Man suit would be to turn over myself, which is tantamount to indentured servitude, or prostitution, depending on what state you're in. [Laughter from the gallery] You can't have it.
Stern: Look, I'm no expert&ndash;
Tony: In prostitution? Of course not, you're a senator. Come on! [More laughter from the gallery as Tony turns to Pepper, who isn't laughing]

[After the battle in Monaco, Tony visits his assailant in jail]
Ivan Vanko: You come from a family of thieves and butchers. And like all guilty men, you try to rewrite your history. To forget all the lives that the Stark family has destroyed.
Tony: Speaking of thieves, where'd you get this design? You look like you have friends in low places.
Vanko: My father, Anton Vanko.
Tony: Never heard of him.
Vanko: My father is the reason you're still alive.
Tony: No. The reason I'm alive is because you made a shot and you missed.
Vanko: [laughs]If you could make God bleed, people would cease to believe in Him. There will be blood in the water. The sharks will come. All I have to do is sit back and watch as the world consumes you.
Tony: Where will you be watching the world consume me from? Oh, that's right, a prison cell. I'll send you a bar of soap. [walks off]

Fury: You've been very busy. You made your girl your CEO, you're giving away all your stuff, you let your friend fly away with your suit. Now, if I knew better—
Tony: You don't know better. I didn't give it to him. He took it.
Fury: Whoa-whoa-whoa, he took it? You're Iron Man, and he just took it? Little brother walked in there, kicked your ass and took your suit? [Turns to Natasha] Is that possible?
Natasha: Well, according to Mr. Stark's database security guidelines, there are redundancies to prevent unauthorized access…
Tony: What do you want from me?
Fury: What do we want from you? Uh uh. What do you want from me? You have become a problem, a problem I have to deal with. Contrary to your belief, you are not the center of my universe. I have [[Thor (film)|bigger problems in the southwest region to deal with. Hit him.
[Natasha sticks a syringe into Tony's neck and injects him with something]
Tony: Oh God, are you gonna steal my kidney and sell it? Could you please not do anything awful for five seconds? What did she just do to me?
Fury: What did we just do for you. That's lithium dioxide. Gonna take the edge off. We're trying to get you back to work.
Tony: Gimme a couple boxes of that, I'll be right as rain.
Natasha: It's not a cure. Just abates the symptoms.
Fury: Doesn't look like it's gonna be an easy fix.

[Vanko shows Hammer how easily he can hack into HammerTech's computer system]
Justin Hammer: Good stuff.
Vanko: Твой софт - говно. [Russian; pronounced "tuh-voy soft, guhv-no"]
Hammer: [Confused] Sorry?
Vanko: Software shit.

Hammer: [After walking into the room where Vanko is working] Hey, there he is! It's the bird man. Now you like the bird. Is that right? Is that your bird? I'm confused. You said it wasn't, but now it looks like you're best of pals. You love that bird, don't you? You know what? [To the guards] Take the bird. [One guard takes the bird away from Vanko]
Vanko: Hey! [The guard puts the bird into a bag]
Hammer: [To the guards again] Take his pillows, too. Both of them. [The other guard take Vanko's pillows away from him] And his shoes. Take his shoes. [Both guards take Vanko's shoes]. I took your stuff. How does that make you feel? You feel bad? Good. [Angry]  'CAUSE THAT'S HOW I FEEL!!! We had a contract! I saved your life, and you give me suits! That was our deal. And you did not deliver. I don't know if you're a genius or a fraud. I don't know what you are. [Calm] Something really, really great fell into my lap. And if it hadn't, I'd be at your mercy tonight. Now I have a piece of Stark tech that I pimped out myself. And now your overpriced paperweights are gonna look like a backdrop to my demonstration. Do you dig what I'm getting at here? 
Vanko: [In Russian]: You talk a bit too much ("Слишком много говоришь");
Hammer: [Sarcastically laughs] I don't know if you know this, [Angry again] BUT I DON'T SPEAK RUSSIAN!!! [calm again] I'm gonna leave now. I'm gonna go to the Expo. Maybe I'll even get laid. [Referring to the guards] You see these guys? They're your babysitters. They are not to be trifled with. When I get back, we're gonna renegotiate the terms of our agreement. And you're gonna make good on our arrangement because if you don't, you're gonna be exactly what you were when I found you: a dead man. You got that? [Pointing to the TV] Maybe you can watch me on TV. [Leaves; Vanko starts looking to the guards, and smiles]

Natasha: Reboot complete. You got your best friend back.
Tony: Thank you very much, Agent Romanoff.
Natasha: Well done with the new chest piece. I'm reading significantly higher output, and your vitals all look promising.
Tony: Yes, for the moment, I'm not dying. Thank you.
Pepper: [Overhearing this on the other line] What do you mean, you're not dying? Did you just say you were dying?  
Tony: That you?  Uh, no, I'm not. Not anymore.
Pepper: What's&ndash;what's going on?
Tony: I was going to tell you. I didn't want to alarm you.
Pepper: [Interrupting] You were gonna tell me? You really were dying?
Tony: You didn't let me.
Pepper: Why didn't you tell me that?
Tony: I was gonna make you an omelette and tell you!
Natasha: Hey, hey, save it for the honeymoon. You got incoming, Tony. Looks like the fight's coming to you.
Tony: Great. Pepper?
Pepper: Are you okay now?
Tony: I am fine. Don't be mad. I will formally apologize&ndash;
Pepper: I am mad.
Tony: &ndash;when I'm not fending off a Hammeroid attack.
Pepper: Fine.
Tony: We could have been in Venice.
Pepper: Oh, please!

Stern: I think "we're done" is the point he's making. I don't think there's any reason&ndash;
Tony: The point is: you're welcome, I guess.
Stern: For what?
Tony: Because I'm your nuclear deterrent. It's working. We're safe. America is secure. You want my property? You can't have it. But I did you a big favor: I've successfully privatized world peace. What more do you want? For now! I tried to play ball with these ass-clowns...
Stern: [bleep] you, Mr. Stark. [bleep] you, buddy.
